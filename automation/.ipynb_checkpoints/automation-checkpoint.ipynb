    "A webpage consists of a number of elements which have their own specific use. In our case, we need to locate the element that is takes input of a search query. Locating specifics elements and their attributes on a web page might seem overwhelming in the beginning, but it is actually easy to do. Let's see how this is done.\n",

    "After you've located your element, you can perform other operations as required.\n",
    "the ```element.clear()``` method is used to remove any existing data present in the text field. ```element.send_keys()``` is used to send text to the element. In our case, we send the query *Hello World!*. Here, ```Keys.RETURN``` is used to append the carriage return character to our input text. Think of this as the equivalent to entering text and hitting the *Enter* button.   \n",
    "That's it, you've have succesfully performed a simple web automation task!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Experiment for yourself!\n",
    "Now, you can experiment with performing more complicated opertions. For example, try navigating to Facebook to automate your login operation. This is similar to what we've done before. Only difference is that you now have to create two different elements.\n",
